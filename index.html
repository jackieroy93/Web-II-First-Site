  <h1> Jackie Royds My Web Experiments! </h1>
  <h4> Hello everybody! </h4>
  <p> Obviously, I'm Jackie! Nice to meet you! I'm sure I know many of you but for those I don't, I really look forward to getting know you! Heres a few fun facts about me so we can start to get to know each other! </p>
  <ul>
    <li> I have been attending RCTC for quite some time but this is my LAST semester (if you listen closely, you can hear a collective sign of relief from all the teachers).</li>
    <li> I am in the following programs:
      <ul>
        <li> Associates of Fine Arts </li>
        <li> Associates of Graphic Design </li>
        <li> Photography Certificate </li>
        <li> Motion Graphics Certificate </li>
        <li> Digital Art Certificate </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> I have a cat named Winnipeg and she's very judgmental. </li>
    <li> I like tattoos, reading, comic books, and chocolate.</li>
    <li> I can't really think of anything else besides: I'm awesome. (Just kidding, I'm not that self-centered) </li>
  </ul>
  <p> I feel like I am forgetting something...Oh yeah! A picture: </p>
